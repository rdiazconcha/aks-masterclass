# Challenge 03 - Craft and deploy your first Manifest file
## Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

## Directions
1. Craft a pod.yaml file that includes a Pod
2. You can use any image you want (e.g. nginx)
3. Deploy the pod.yaml file to the Kubernetes cluster
4. Describe the Pod by using `kubectl describe`
5. Try to set container limits (execute `kubectl explain Pod.spec.containers.resources` to understand how)

## Questions
1. What happens if you delete the Pod?
2. Is there any other way to create a Pod?
